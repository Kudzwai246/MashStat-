    <h1>Runna Rulez: Not “Upcoming”—Already Here</h1>
    <p>
      A fresh face? Hardly. <strong>Runna Rulez</strong>, the young hip‑hop talent who first exploded onto the scene with his 2024 hit “Murume,” has proven beyond doubt that he’s no longer an “upcoming” artist—but very much a defining voice of Zimbabwe’s rap landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calling Runna Rulez “upcoming” isn’t just inaccurate—it’s borderline disrespectful. His breakout single “Murume” became an instant street anthem and rack‑record streamer across platforms from YouTube to Spotify, earning him critical acclaim and packed venues long before he even considered a full album release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he has yet to land an entry on the MashA 50 albums chart, industry insiders and fans alike agree he isn’t a mere future chart entry—he’s already chart‑topping material in waiting. His uncompromising style, razor‑sharp lyricism, and fearless delivery make him one of the most exciting voices in Zimbabwean hip‑hop today.
